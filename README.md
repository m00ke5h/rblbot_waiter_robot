# Waiter robot for cafe 

- ```src/final.py``` is the final python executable for the fully programmed bot.
- I have used multithreading and OOP concepts to complete the code.
##### After building your package using ```catkin_make```, launch the ```irckt.launch``` file using -
```bash
$ roslaunch rblbot_description irckt.launch
```
##### Now run the python executable using -
```bash
$ rosrun rblbot_description final.py
```
##### A controller will pop up which will allow you to give commands to the bot.
